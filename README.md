# deRision

This project provides a number of python scripts to automate common eVision activities.
These are implemented as a set of browser macros that automate navigation through the eVision site.
In order to use these scripts, you will need to install a
[browser driver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/)
that matches your platform and browser. The scripts are configured with work with the Chrome driver
placed in the root folder of the project.
